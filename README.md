## 📌 What is Data Science?

**Data Science** is a multidisciplinary field that combines statistical techniques, machine learning, and programming to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data.

It plays a crucial role in industries such as **healthcare, finance, retail, and technology** by enabling data-driven decision-making.

### Key Components of Data Science:
- **Data Analysis** – Understanding trends and patterns in data  
- **Data Visualization** – Presenting insights visually for better comprehension  
- **Predictive Modeling** – Forecasting outcomes using machine learning models  
- **Big Data Technologies** – Handling large-scale datasets with tools like Hadoop and Spark
